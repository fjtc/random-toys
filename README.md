# random-toys

This is a repository with some random toys I created for one reason or another. 
They are mostly composed by small code examples I sent to someone or dumny 
programs I wrote to test something else.

All programs inside this repository comes with no support nor guarantees of any
kind. Feel free to use them the way you want. No need to give credits.
